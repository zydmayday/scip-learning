Q:
Exercise 1.8.  Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is given by the value


Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the square-root procedure. (In section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement Newton's method in general as an abstraction of these square-root and cube-root procedures.)

A:
(define (cube-root x)
  (cube-root-iter 1.0 x))

(define (cube-root-iter guess x)
  (if (guess-enough? guess (improve guess x))
      (improve guess x)
      (cube-root-iter (improve guess x) x)))

(define (guess-enough? old-guess new-guess)
  (> 0.01
     (/ (abs (- old-guess new-guess))
        old-guess)))

(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x
           (* guess guess))
        (* 2 guess))
     3))
